## Best Practice tools

- [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) create react webpack application

- [redux](https://github.com/reactjs/redux) redux flux implementation

- [react-redux](https://github.com/reactjs/react-redux) provide handy methods for using redux in react

- [redux-thunk](https://github.com/gaearon/redux-thunk) provide methods for async redux actions

- [immutable-js](https://facebook.github.io/immutable-js/) Immutable data structures for JavaScript! Store your state in these, in order to make sure it isn't mutated where it shouldn't be, and to enforce reducer purity.

- [reselect](https://github.com/reactjs/reselect) Use this for composable, lazily-evaluated, views into your state. For example, for a particular component you might want to:
    - inject only the relevant part of the global state tree, rather than the whole thing
    - inject extra derived data, like totals or validation state, without putting it all in the store
- [normalizr](https://github.com/paularmstrong/normalizr)
