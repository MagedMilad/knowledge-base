# Working with Active Record

Active Record class named `Client` will be mapped to the `clients` table

```ruby
class Client < ActiveRecord::Base
    self.table_name = "CLIENT"
    self.primary_key = "CLIENT_ID"
end
```

## overriding default accessor in ActiveRecord
first name the method with the same name as the arrtibute
```ruby
# orriding default read accessor
class Specification < ActiveRecord::Base
    def tolerance
        self[:tolerance] || 'n/a'
    end
end
# orriding default write accessor
class SillyFortuneCookie < ActiveRecord::Base
    def message=(txt)
        self[:message] = txt + ' in bed'
    end
end
```

## ActiveRecord::Store
Rails introduced the store declaration, which uses serialize behind the scenes to declare
a single-column key/value store. (store a hash)
```ruby
class User < ActiveRecord::Base
    store :preferences
end
```

## Creating New Active Record Instances

```ruby
c = Client.new
#<Client id: nil, name: nil, code: nil>
c.new_record?
# true
c.persisted?
# false
```
we can use `create` or `new` function to create new ActiveRecord instance and both can accept block of initialization

`create` save the recrod in the database

`new` don't save 'persist' the record until you do so

## The Query Cache
By default, Rails attempts to optimize performance by turning on a simple query cache. It is a hash stored on
the current thread, one for every active database connection

You can enable the query cache manually by wrapping operations in a cache block

```ruby
User.cache do
    puts User.first
    puts User.first
    puts User.first
end
```

## Touching Records
There may be certain cases where updating a time field to indicate a record was viewed is all you require,
and Active Record provides a convenience method for doing so in the form of `touch`
```ruby
>> user = User.first
>> user.touch # => sets updated_at to now.
>> user.touch(:viewed_at) # sets viewed_at and updated_at to now.


class User < ActiveRecord::Base
belongs_to :client, touch: true
end
>> user.touch # => also calls user.client.touch
```

## Readonly Attributes
```ruby
class Customer < ActiveRecord::Base
    attr_readonly :social_security_number
end

>> customer = Customer.new(social_security_number: "130803020")
#<Customer id: 1, social_security_number: "130803020", ...>
>> customer.social_security_number
# "130803020"
>> customer.save
>> customer.social_security_number = "000000000"
>> customer.social_security_number
# "000000000"

# Note, no error raised!
customer.save
customer.reload
customer.social_security_number
"130803020" # the original readonly value is preserved
```

## Database Locking
### Optimistic Locking
Optimistic locking describes the strategy of detecting and resolving collisions if they occur, and is commonly
recommended in multi-user situations where collisions should be infrequent.

#### Implementation
If you control your database schema, optimistic locking is really simple to implement. Just add an integer
column named lock_version to a given table, with a default value of zero.
```ruby
class AddLockVersionToTimesheets < ActiveRecord::Migration
    def change
        add_column :timesheets, :lock_version, :integer, default: 0
    end
end
```
Simply adding that lock_version column changes Active Recordâ€™s behavior. Now if the same record is loaded
as two different model instances and saved differently, the first instance will win the update, and the second
one will cause an `ActiveRecord::StaleObjectError` to be raised.

### Pessimistic Locking

```ruby
Timesheet.transaction do
    t = Timesheet.lock.first
    t.approved = true
    t.save!
end
```

## ActiveRecord Query

```ruby
# where
# where accept hash or string
Product.where(sku: params[:sku])
# hash form is intellegent to understand in clause
Product.where(sku: [9400,9500,9900])
Product.where('sku in (?)', selected_skus)
Article.where.not(title: 'Rails 3')
Article.where.not(title: ['Rails 3', 'Rails 5'])
# binding variables
Product.where("name = :name AND sku = :sku AND created_at > :date", name: "Space Toilet", sku: 80800, date: '2009-01-01')
# boolean
Timesheet.where('submitted = ?', true)
# nil condition
User.where(email: nil)
# order
Timesheet.order('created_at desc')
Timesheet.order(:created_at)
# limit & offset
Timesheet.limit(10).offset(10)
# select
BillableWeek.select("mon_hrs + tues_hrs as two_day_total").first
# full sql query
select("#{table_name}.*").
    from("#{table_name}, tags, taggings").
    where("#{table_name}.#{primary_key} = taggings.taggable_id
    and taggings.tag_id = tags.id
    and tags.name IN (?)",
    Tag.parse(list))
# exists?
# use ids, hash/string clause, or like ruby exists?
User.exists?(1)
User.exists?(login: "mack")
User.exists?(id: [1, 3, 5])
User.where(login: "mack").exists?
# extending
# Specifies one or many modules with methods that will extend the scope with additional methods.
module Pagination
    def page(number)
        # pagination code
    end
end
scope = Model.all.extending(Pagination)
scope.page(params[:page])
# group
Account.select('name, SUM(cash) as money').group('name').to_a
# having
User.group("created_at").having(["created_at > ?", 2.days.ago])
# joins
Buyer.select('buyers.id, count(carts.id) as cart_count').
    joins('left join carts on carts.buyer_id = buyers.id').
    group('buyers.id')
# uniq / distinct
User.select(:login).uniq
```
