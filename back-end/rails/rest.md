# REST in Rails

## Routing and CRUD
```ruby
resources :auctions
```
into your `config/routes.rb` file, you will have created four named routes

|Helper Method|GET|POST|PATCH|DELETE|
|-------------|----|---|---|----|
|client_path(client) | /clients/1 `show`||/clients/1 `update`|/clients/1 `destroy`|
|clients_path|/clients `index`|/clients `create`|||
|edit_client_path(client)|/clients/1/edit `edit`||||
|new_client_path|/clients/new `new`||||

1. The default request method is `GET`.
2. In a `form_tag` or `form_for` call, the POST method will be used automatically.
3. When you need to (which is going to be mostly with PATCH and DELETE operations), you can specify
a request method along with the URL generated by the named route.

```ruby
link_to "Delete", auction_path(auction), method: :delete
```

## Singular and Plural RESTful Routes
As you may have noticed, some of the RESTful routes are singular; some are plural. The logic is as follows:
1. The routes for show , new , edit , and destroy are singular, because theyâ€™re working on a particular
resource.
2. The rest of the routes are plural. They deal with collections of related resources.

## Limiting Routes Generated
```ruby
resources :clients, except: [:index]
resources :clients, only: [:new, :create]
```

## Nested Resources
```ruby
resources :auctions do
    resources :bids
end
```

What that tells the routing mapper is that you want RESTful routes for auction resources; that is, you want
`auctions_url` , `edit_auction_url` , and all the rest of it. You also want RESTful routes for bids: `auction_bids_url` , `new_auction_bid_url` , and so forth.

```ruby
resources :auctions do
    resources :bids do
        match :retract, via: [:get, :post], on: :member
    end
end
```
retract_auction_bid GET|POST

`/auctions/:auction_id/bids/:id/retract(.:format) bids#retract`

```ruby
resources :auctions do
    match :terminate, via: [:get, :post], on: :collection
end
```
This example will give you a `terminate_auctions_path` method
