# Tree Types
- ## Binary Tree
    + A binary tree is a tree in which **each node has up to two children**
- ## Binary Search Tree
    + A binary search tree is a binary tree in which every node fits a specific ordering property: **all left descendents <= n < all right descendents**. This must be true for each node n
- ## Balanced vs. Unbalanced
    + a "balanced" tree really means something more like "not terribly imbalÂ­ anced:' **It's balanced enough to ensure `O(log N)` times for insert and find**, but it's not necessarily as balanced as it could be.
    + Examples
        * Red Black Trees
        * AVL Trees
- ## Complete Binary Trees
    + A complete binary tree is a binary tree in which every level of the tree is fully filled, **except for perhaps the last level. To the extent that the last level is filled, it is filled left to right**.
- ## Full Binary Trees
    + A full binary tree is a binary tree in which every node has either zero or two children. That is, **no nodes have only one child**.
- ## Perfect Binary Trees
    + A perfect binary tree is one that is both full and complete. All leaf nodes will be at the same level, and this level has the maximum number of nodes.
